#General usage notes

This code allows a probabilistic tumor segmentation based on [1] and [2]. Spatial regularisation by means of Markov random fields is not included.
		
##Install

Python 2.7 should be installed. 

In a terminal, run
```
python setup.py install
```
to complete the installation.

##Code execution

  * Only one command line script is provided, which will run an example. To do so, run  
```
python main.py
```
  * To use another dataset - in `main.py` set:   
    1. Path(s) to T1, T1c, T2 and/or FLAIR images in the `image_files` dictionary. Supply at least one path, at most all four paths. The algorithm will look for hypointense tumors in T1 and for hyperintense tumors in T1c, T2 and FLAIR.
    2. Paths to wm, gm and csf atlas files in the `atlas` dictionary. Please supply all three of the atlas files.
    3. Path to a brain mask in `brats_flair_mask`, optional, can be set to None.
    3. Path to store results in `save_dir`, optional, can be set to None.   
__Make sure that all your images, mask(s) and atlas maps (GM, WM and CSF) are in the same reference space and have the same resolution and dimension__!

##Results

Results are written to a directory the user specifies via `save_dir` in `ems_write_output.WriteOutput()`. By default, results are 
written in a subdirectory ems_results of the directory of the input MR images. This directory, ems_results/, contains:

> gm<*param_string*>.nii
> :  grey matter segmentation of the subjects brain
	
> wm<*param_string*>.nii
> :  white matter segmentation of the subjects brain

> csf<*param_string*>.nii
> :  csf matter segmentation of the subjects brain

> <*modality*>_tumor<*param_string*>.nii
> :  tumor segmentation for modality <modality>,

where `param_string` is set in `ems_write_output.WriteOutput()`.
